            Hello there, this is a small monologue from my side on my perspectives on how to live life and what drives me to do anything. Though things might change with time,
            my mentality that I have developed over the years will only grow to be much stronger.
        </p><p>I believe we are living in a golden age of information.
        We millennials are the only ones who can differentiate between a time when there was no internet and present age.</p>
        <p>
        Hence, I say instead of being scared and intimidated of the big ocean of options and opportunities, we should embrace it and utilize it to our best possible ability.
        I quote the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz by saying that we live in the “best of all possible worlds”.
        </p>
        <p>I believe that to “tame this beast” of the internet,
        we need discipline and integrity and the mental strength…….to only take what is really essential and not get distracted by the endless depths of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>I also believe that excellence is not something that is “inherited” nor “developed” but a mix of both. I believe that even for innate talent to grow, we need the right guidance and motivation.
        With these principles as pillars to my mental fort, I row in the ocean of life always looking for the big challenges to face and hurdles to cross…….
