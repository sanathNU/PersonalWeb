                <p>I have been learning GCP ( Google Cloud Platform) and am familiar with the technology.I also have worked with many Deep Learning and Machine Learning libraries like TensorFlow, 
                    Keras, PyTorch. I have a basic idea of writing smart-contracts in solidity.

                    I would like to contribute as much as I can to this field</p>

              <p>Apart from this having the hottest jobs on the market and the most sought after, this field is revolutionizing the way our digital world works.
                   Also, with the latest plans of a ‘Metaverse’, the concept of AI bots will be taken to the next level with realization of fully 3d responsible AI.
                   It will be an exciting time for AI and I plan to sure be a part of it!<br>

            <h3>Blockchain and Decentralization</h3>
            <p> Usually, these terms are currently associated with Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. But the philosophical and techincal ideas behind this is truly ingenious. This is one of those
                'Once-in-a-century' idea which can have huge implications, not only on our financial systems but all other fields like defence, education, etc.
                 As the Youtuber Siraj Raval points <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWOdAAFoSFE">here</a>, we should work towards building Decentralized Artificial Intelligence.
                 That I what I am towards contributing!

    <p style = "text-align:center"> I believe we are living in a golden age of information. We millennials are the only ones who can differentiate between a time when there was no internet and present age. Hence, I say instead of being scared and intimidated of from this, we should embrace it and utilize it to our best possible ability. I quote the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz by saying that we live in the “best of all possible worlds”. <br>I believe that to “tame this beast” of the internet, we need discipline and integrity and the mental strength…….to only take what is really essential and not get distracted by the endless depths of the internet.
        I also believe that excellence is not something that is “inherited” nor “developed” but a mix of both. I believe that even for talent to grow, we need the right guidance and motivation.
        With these principles as pillars to my mental fort, I row in the ocean of life always looking for the big challenges to face and hurdles to cross…….
