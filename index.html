          <h1>Interests</h1>
          My interests range from highly theoretical topics like complexity theory, neural networks to highly hardware oriented topics like quantum computing, hardware security. Here are my reasons for liking some of the domains:<br>
          
              <div class= 'content-inside'><h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
              <p> I believe that Quantum Computing Truly has the power to change the world! The innovations in the field are simply mind blowing! The applications....endless! Though it is in no way related to quantum mechanics, it is built around the foundations of it. I find this a very fascinating connection<br>
            As the famous physicisist once said, "If you think you know, quantum mechanics, you don't"!. I think with more people learning about this field, there will truly be huge growth in the world!</p>
            </div>
              <div class = 'content-inside'>
              <h3>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h3>
              <p>Apart from this having the hottest jobs on the market and the most sought after, this field is revolutionizing the way our digital world works. Also, with the latest plans of a ‘Metaverse’, the concept of AI bots will be taken to the next level with realization of fully 3d responsible AI. It will be an exciting time for AI.<br>

      <div class='content'><h1>My Philosophy</h1>
        <div class='content-inside'>
    <p style = "text-align:center"> I believe we are living in a golden age of information. We millennials are the only ones who can differentiate between a time when there was no internet and present age. Hence, I say instead of being scared and intimidated of from this, we should embrace it and utilize it to our best possible ability.<br> I quote the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz by saying that we live in the “best of all possible worlds”.<br> I believe that to “tame this beast” of the internet, we need discipline and integrity and the mental strength…….to only take what is really essential and not get distracted by the endless depths of the internet.
        I also believe that excellence is not something that is “inherited” nor “developed” but a mix of both. I believe that even for talent to grow, we need the right guidance and motivation.
        With these principles as pillars to my mental fort, I row in the ocean of life always looking for the big challenges to face and hurdles to cross…….
